# mcubed-workshop
Introduction to Neural Networks at Minds Mastering Machines [M³] London 2017

Expects Python 3

[Start here when local or on Github](workshop.ipynb)


## Local Installation

1. Install Anaconda 3 for Python 3.6: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
1. Install TensorFlow for Anaconda: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#InstallingAnaconda
   * e.g. like ```pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.3.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl```
1. Install Keras using pip: ```pip install keras --upgrade```     


## Recommended Installation

We recommend to fork this repository and let if run on a GPU based system. One that works well is AWS p2.xlarge EC2 instance.

This can get you started: https://blog.keras.io/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-gpu-on-aws-a-starter-guide.html

## Installation on Azure Notebooks (fallback)

1. Go to: https://notebooks.azure.com/djcordhose/libraries/mcubed/html/workshop.ipynb
1. Click on `Clone` button at the top of the page
1. This brings you to the Microsoft login page: Either log in with an existing account or create a new one, it is free of charge
1. After this you get redirected to the notebook which now is hosted by a running server
1. If you can execute cells as described in the notebook you are all set
